# Laviana

Laviana is a simple Discord bot created to send announcements to a Discord server. The bot was developed as a personal project to help learn and improve my skills with **Node.js** and **Discord.js**.

## Motivation

I created this project as part of my journey to learn **Node.js** and explore **Discord bot development**. Through building Laviana, I aimed to understand the fundamentals of interacting with the Discord API and managing bot functionalities using **Discord.js**.
